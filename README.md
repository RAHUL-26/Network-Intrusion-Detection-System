# Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) using Machine Learning

## Overview
This project aims to develop a robust Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) using machine learning algorithms. The NIDS is designed to analyze network traffic data and identify potential intrusions or attacks on a network. The project utilizes the CICIDS2017 dataset, which contains labeled network traffic data for various types of network attacks.

## Project Structure
The project is structured as follows:
- 📊 **Data Preprocessing**: The raw dataset is preprocessed to handle missing values, encode categorical features, and normalize numerical features.
- 🎯 **Feature Selection**: Selecting the most relevant features to improve model performance and reduce computational complexity.
- 🛠️ **Model Building**: Training machine learning models such as Random Forest, Support Vector Machine (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Decision Tree on the preprocessed dataset.
- 📈 **Evaluation**: Evaluating the performance of each model using evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- 📊 **Visualization**: Visualizing the results using graphs and plots to gain insights into the performance of different models.

## Instructions
